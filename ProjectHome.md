Inspired by Guitar Hero series, LittleBigStar and other projects, this tool allows to actually learn guitar playing. Easy interface for both scholar and tutor. Tool offers audio/visual helpers to support education for beginners.

Milestones:
1. Bind PortAudio and ASIO driver (done, 99%; bug: sometimes LineIn is not recognized and Mic port must be used instead, with 8x signal amplification).

2. Single pitch analyzer by using Tartini project (Tuner) (done).

3. Simple lesson (hand made data structure; non-chord lesson, just to test Scholar interface) (in progress; approx 90% done, TODO: fix couple of bugs and commit; game mode must be implemented).

> <-- First commit after this step; Start issue tracking

4. Gaming interface, statistics. (started, 5%).

5. Tutor interface. (90+%; majority is done, minor stuff is comming)

6. Chord analyzer (Specter Comb, etc.) (~95% done; minor bugs in editor).

7. Sound mixing, sound effects support, metronome (90% done: a minor bug with FX UI; only 2 effects are present).

8. Audio/visual helpers, background audio support (started, 15%).

9. Skins, language support, options (program tuning), other minor stuff.
